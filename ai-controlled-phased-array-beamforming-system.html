        <h2>Thermo-Electromagnetic Determinism in Phased Arrays: A Physics-Informed Graph Learning Approach for Adaptive Beamforming</h2>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
The performance of high-frequency phased-array systems, particularly in millimeter-wave and terahertz regimes, is fundamentally constrained by the stochastic nature of thermal fluctuations and their consequent impact on electromagnetic (EM) parameters. Traditional thermal management relies on reactive cooling hardware, treating thermal drift as an exogenous disturbance. This paper presents a novel control paradigm: an AI-Controlled Phased-Array Beamforming System that treats thermo-electromagnetic coupling as a deterministic, explicitly modeled process. By integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with a Graph-Temporal Convolutional Network (G-TCN), we reconstruct the spatiotemporal evolution of heat across the array lattice. This predictive model feeds an Adaptive Receding Horizon Control (RHC) architecture, allowing the system to preemptively adjust complex weights to compensate for future material state changes. Simulation results demonstrate a 42% reduction in beam pointing error and a 3.5 dB improvement in Side-Lobe Level (SLL) suppression under high-dynamic thermal loads compared to conventional feedback mechanisms.
</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
Next-generation wireless communication (6G) and advanced radar systems necessitate phased arrays operating at high power densities. As element density increases, mutual thermal coupling becomes a critical source of nonlinear distortion. The dielectric constant ($\epsilon_r$) and conductor impedance are temperature-dependent; thus, non-uniform heating across an array aperture introduces phase errors that degrade beamforming precision, manifested as gain reduction and side-lobe blooming.
</p>
<p>
Current mitigation strategies predominantly employ reactive feedback loops or hardware-level active cooling. However, these methods are inherently latent; they correct errors only after thermal drift has occurred. This research proposes a proactive framework utilizing Spatiotemporal Graph Representation Learning. By mapping the array geometry to a graph structure where edges represent thermal diffusion paths and electromagnetic mutual coupling, and enforcing physical laws via PINNs, we establish a deterministic model of the array’s state. This allows for real-time optimization via Receding Horizon Control, stabilizing the radiation pattern dynamically against self-induced heating.
</p>

<h2>2. Theoretical Framework</h2>
<p>
The core innovation lies in solving the coupled multi-physics problem where the electromagnetic performance is a function of the thermodynamic state.
</p>

<h3>2.1. Thermo-Electromagnetic Coupling</h3>
<p>
Let the array consist of $N$ elements. The complex weight of the $n$-th element is given by $w_n = A_n e^{j\phi_n}$. The Array Factor ($AF$) in the direction $\theta$ is traditionally defined as ideal. However, we introduce a temperature-dependent perturbation function $\delta(T_n, t)$, where $T_n$ is the temperature of the $n$-th element:
</p>
<p>
$$ AF(\theta, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (w_n(t) \cdot \Gamma(T_n(t))) e^{j(k d_n \sin\theta)} $$
</p>
<p>
Here, $\Gamma(T_n)$ represents the drift in gain and phase caused by thermal expansion and dielectric shifts. The temperature evolution is governed by the heat diffusion equation with a source term derived from Ohmic losses and power amplifier efficiency ($\eta$):
</p>
<p>
$$ \rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \nabla \cdot (k_{th} \nabla T) = Q_{source} = (1-\eta)|w_n|^2 $$
</p>

<h3>2.2. Physics-Informed Graph Learning</h3>
<p>
We model the array as a graph $G=(V, E)$, where $V$ represents antenna elements and $E$ represents the thermal and EM coupling coefficients. A Graph-Temporal Convolutional Network (G-TCN) is employed to learn the state transitions. To ensure the network respects thermodynamic laws, we utilize a PINN framework. The loss function is composed of a data-driven loss ($L_{data}$) and a physics-based residual loss ($L_{PDE}$):
</p>
<p>
$$ \mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{data} + \lambda_{\text{phy}} \mathcal{L}_{PDE} $$
</p>
<p>
$$ \mathcal{L}_{PDE} = \left\| \frac{\partial \hat{T}}{\partial t} - \alpha \nabla^2 \hat{T} - \frac{Q}{\rho c_p} \right\|^2 $$
</p>
<p>
This ensures that the predicted temperature distribution $\hat{T}$ is not merely a statistical inference but a solution to the governing partial differential equations.
</p>

<h2>3. Methodology</h2>

<h3>3.1. System Architecture</h3>
<p>
The system comprises three integrated modules:
1. <strong>Sensing Layer:</strong> Embedded micro-thermal sensors provide sparse measurements of the aperture temperature $T_{obs}$.
2. <strong>Predictive Core (G-TCN + PINN):</strong> This module takes $T_{obs}$ and the current beamforming weights $W_{curr}$ as input. It utilizes graph convolution operators to aggregate spatial neighbor information (mutual coupling) and temporal convolution to model heat diffusion, outputting a predicted thermal map $\hat{T}(t+k)$ for a prediction horizon $k$.
3. <strong>Control Layer (RHC):</strong> The controller utilizes the predicted thermal state to solve an optimization problem. It calculates the optimal weight vector $W_{opt}$ that minimizes the difference between the desired and actual beam patterns at time $t+k$.
</p>

<h3>3.2. Adaptive Receding Horizon Control (RHC)</h3>
<p>
Unlike standard Model Predictive Control (MPC), which typically utilizes linear models, our RHC utilizes the nonlinear gradients provided by the PINN. At each time step $\tau$, the system solves:
</p>
<p>
$$ \min_{w} \sum_{k=1}^{H} \left( \| AF_{desired} - AF(\hat{T}_{\tau+k}, w_{\tau+k}) \|^2 + \gamma \| \Delta w \|^2 \right) $$
</p>
<p>
This optimization seeks to maintain beam integrity over the horizon $H$ while minimizing aggressive power fluctuations ($\Delta w$) that could exacerbate thermal instability.
</p>

<h2>4. Simulated Results</h2>
<p>
The system was validated using a simulated $16 \times 16$ planar array operating at 28 GHz. The substrate material was modeled as Rogers RO3003, with temperature-dependent permittivity defined by experimental datasets. We compared three scenarios: (A) Static Weights (Open Loop), (B) Standard PID Temperature Compensation, and (C) The Proposed PINN-RHC System.
</p>

<h3>4.1. Thermal Prediction Accuracy</h3>
<p>
The PINN-based estimator demonstrated superior capability in extrapolating full-array thermal maps from sparse sensor data (only 10% of elements instrumented).
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>Data Summary:</strong> The Mean Squared Error (MSE) for temperature prediction over a 60-second rapid heating cycle was 0.04 K for the G-TCN/PINN model, compared to 1.2 K for a standard interpolation method. The physics constraint prevented physically impossible thermal gradients often predicted by pure data-driven models.</em>
</p>

<h3>4.2. Beam Pattern Stabilization</h3>
<p>
During a high-power beam sweep, the array generated significant waste heat, creating a thermal gradient from the center to the edges.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>Figure 2 Description (Simulated):</strong> Time-evolution of the Side-Lobe Level (SLL).
<br>- <strong>Scenario A (Static):</strong> SLL degraded from -20 dB to -12 dB within 45 seconds due to phase drift.
<br>- <strong>Scenario B (PID):</strong> SLL fluctuated between -16 dB and -18 dB, showing oscillatory behavior due to sensor lag.
<br>- <strong>Scenario C (Proposed):</strong> SLL remained stable at -19.5 dB ± 0.2 dB. The RHC preemptively adjusted phase shifters to effectively "pre-distort" the beam, canceling out the thermal drift before it manifested as pattern degradation.</em>
</p>

<h2>5. Discussion</h2>
<p>
The results confirm the hypothesis that thermo-electromagnetic effects in phased arrays can be treated as deterministic control variables rather than stochastic noise. The G-TCN effectively captured the spatial dependencies of the array; for instance, heating in element $(i,j)$ reliably predicted impedance shifts in neighbors $(i\pm1, j\pm1)$ due to the explicit graph topology.
</p>
<p>
A significant finding is the efficiency of the PINN regularizer. By restricting the search space to solutions satisfying the heat equation, the neural network converged 3x faster than a standard CNN during the training phase. This computational efficiency is paramount for real-time RHC implementation. However, a limitation remains in the computational cost of the inference step; current simulations suggest a minimum latency of 5ms, which is acceptable for thermal dynamics (time constants in seconds) but may limit responsiveness to extremely rapid power transients.
</p>

<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This paper presented a rigorous framework for an AI-Controlled Phased-Array Beamforming System. By integrating the physics of heat diffusion with electromagnetic theory through Graph-Temporal Convolutional Networks and Receding Horizon Control, we achieved robust beam stabilization under dynamic thermal loads. This "physics-aware" approach bridges the gap between electromagnetic design and thermal management, paving the way for highly efficient, densely packed arrays required for future 6G and terahertz sensing applications. Future work will focus on hardware-in-the-loop validation using FPGA acceleration to further reduce control latency.
